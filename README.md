# SwapOriginAndCompanion

The purpose of this Baldur's Gate 3 mod is to allow the player to swap the origin character with a party companion, such that they can exchange dialogue with one another, perform the swap in a convenient and fast way without using console commands, roleplay romance between the alternating avatars, and who knows what else. The ideal goal is to make this code as stable as possible to not break any important cut scenes or quest lines. I assume approval, romance state, and other important parameters are preserved between swaps, but further testing is needed to verify.

I recommend using the Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager to use this mod in game. All you need is the SwapOriginAndCompanion.pak file.

If you want to compile this mod with new source code I recommend taking a look at these guides:
